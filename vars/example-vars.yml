# Here you can override defaults from playbooks
# Example:
# centos_yum_additional_tools: []
#
# All .yml files (except of this file) will be ignored from this repository

# Most probably you will want to override two variables
# First one is developer account password.
# centos_users_developer_password: YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
# Please remember that you need to encrypt password here, it can be set as a plaintext. Check roles/defaults/main.yml (at the bottom of the file) to check how to generate such password
# If you plan to commit this file somewhere it's important to use Ansible Vault for that purpose

# Second variable that you might want to override is path to your public file. It will be added to authorized_keys on the server so you can login easily over SSH
# Logging it with password via SSH is strongly NOT recommended
# centos_users_developer_authorized_key_path: PATH_TO_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE
